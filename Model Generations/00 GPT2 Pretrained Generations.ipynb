drew his sword and pointed at the peculiar young lady. \"Do what you need to in this town!\" he roared. \"We'll give it some time.\"\n","\n","\n","* * * * *\n","\n","\n","When the battle had gone on for three days without the use of gunfire, it was evident that the enemy army was not as powerful as he had been led to believe. The enemy did not possess a strong force of cavalry, as they often did during the day, let alone the infantry, but it was still capable of pushing the enemy back so far. The general felt it was imperative that they make use of every available source in their power, and on this very day his troops found themselves completely surrounded in their own camp.\n","\n","\n","The soldier who had led up to the enemy's position ordered that the prisoners of war come to his relief, while he himself marched to his camp, intending to relieve his comrades in the meantime. To his utter amazement, the wounded and sick found themselves outside his tent, and many of them soon lost consciousness. When the guards found out about this, they were furious with their own leader, saying that they refused to be the first men to go to relief.\n","\n","\n","On entering the camp, some thirty men were ordered into a small fire-place, which served as their shelter. A handful of soldiers came forward, but the general had already sent to them. Some of the prisoners stood up at one time, and others turned their backs, as if unsure of their own strength and lack of ammunition. As the general walked by the prisoners, a man in one of the first groups turned his back to him, but the general spoke. \"You want to come with?\"\n","\n","\n","\"Not with,\" the prisoner answered, but he did not say what he expected from the general of the Third Army, nor did he know who it was. In fact, he had no specific order to take the prisoners. He thought it very odd, that the prisoner, without realizing it, had come to serve as his bodyguard. He felt a deep sense of responsibility for his fellow soldiers, for he had been the cause of what had happened. But then, he felt, he was only doing what the man would have done, had they been in his position. The officer who led him walked over and put his arm around the soldier's shoulders. \"You'll be safe here,\" he said, \"because I'm your General.\"\n","\n","\n","They sat there in silence for quite a while, each soldier trying to grasp at what had just happened. The general did not speak any more. He was beginning to tire, and finally, his staff officer came up to him, placed a hand on his thigh. \"I think it would be best if you took the prisoner to a certain area,\" he instructed him. \"He may still be dangerous, but we shall see what is in store for him. Now, you can leave if you wish, but the general will stay for a while longer.\" It was obvious that this was the last opportunity the prisoners of war to enjoy a brief respite. By now they were on their way to their appointed place. It was as though he had ordered them to get back on horseback. \"We'll be back as quickly as we can,\" he assured them. After a moment or two, some of the prisoners left the fire-place, while others sat down at their camp. The other soldiers were not aware that he had gone away until he was out of sight and had returned with the men he had taken with him into the enemy's camp. They were confused as to why they were left in the middle of nowhere, but at least now the general would know where his force was located and which side of the front was at the head.\n","\n","\n","In order to be able to count all the soldiers in his command, the general ordered a small board with numbers to be placed all around him. These numbers were numbered from 1 to 99, and each one was to count to twenty from 1 to 20, in descending order of importance, and the general himself would be counted one by one every ten steps. The number 99 stood for the General of the Third Army. There were about one hundred of them at his command, all with their numbers printed out. The men in front were numbered on the board, with the few behind them counting to nine. The general also made sure every man had a uniform and clothes, so that they could be recognized and, above all, that they would be able to take care of themselves, if anything happened. At the head of this column stood the general, with all the men in the front, and then each man at the front had a weapon in his hand, and could fire at any time without disturbing his colleagues. The people were separated into groups, each with a flag, and the general set up his tent as the camp commander for all those who wanted him out.\n","\n","\n","The general's instructions to his men were simple: lie down and lay down on their sides.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Set the model to evaluate to run prompts on the model for generation\n","model.eval()\n","\n","prompt_text = '''Nihara the warrior princess was calm in the face of danger.\n","No one dared challenge her now.\n","'''\n","\n","\n","#Convert the prompt text to tokens and add the attention mask\n","input_ids = tokenizer(prompt_text, return_tensors = \"pt\").input_ids\n","attention_mask = tokenizer(\n","    prompt_text, return_tensors=\"pt\"\n",").attention_mask\n","\n","#Send converted prompt and attention mask to GPU\n","input_ids = input_ids.to(device)\n","attention_mask = attention_mask.to(device)\n","\n","\n","#Generate the output from the model based on the parameter set here\n","output = model.generate(\n","    input_ids = input_ids,\n","    attention_mask = attention_mask,\n","    pad_token_id = tokenizer.pad_token_id,\n","    max_length = 1024,\n","    num_beams = 10,\n","    min_length = 1000,\n","    temperature = 3.5,\n","    top_k = 50,\n","    do_sample = True,\n",")\n","\n","\n","generated_text = tokenizer.decode(output[0],skip_special_tokens = True)\n","\n","\n","\n","print(generated_text)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"5WnaAreSubBg","outputId":"d57b7791-5a40-4592-c183-04176a2e02e6"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Nihara the warrior princess was calm in the face of danger.\n","No one dared challenge her now.\n","\"I will defeat you.

You don't believe that I can do it, though?\"\n","When he turned around to confront Hachiman, Naofumi felt something strange. He felt Naofu's breath on the sword and it was even more than usual. He wanted to ask Hachiman about that... but how would he get the sword?\n","\"No, that isn't the problem. I won't just sit idly in front of you like before. What I'm asking you is whether your resolve can be said to outweigh your ability. That is the true test. Whether you can reach your goal now or will you fail to do it when you make a mistake of such magnitude? Are you that strong? Are we that strong in the end?\"\n","With that said, Naofumi looked up to Noda.\n","\"If you want, I'm also going to make sure it's this way as well.\"\n","Naofumi looked around the village.\n","In the city where he was living, there were people gathered together in groups.\n","\"In the end... why do they continue to say that Naofumi can't win? Well, the fact they didn't want him to enter the village before was because they didn't think that there would be a miracle. Now, I can see that they are a bit wrong. If there would be no miracle, everyone would realize it. But that is not possible to happen right now, so they continue to say it's all possible. However, that is not the kind of reasoning I use. I'm only interested in whether this is something we can accomplish today.\"\n","\"What?\"\n","\"If the people can realize that this is only possible if they can believe in it, then I see no reason why we cannot do it.\"\n","\"Exactly.\"\n","\"Then I will do it tomorrow and make that village look as if nothing is wrong. This is all I ask of all of you. There will be no turning back from that. After all, there was no way Naofumi could fight against me.\"\n","\"That doesn't sound like a reasonable reason for all of us.\"\n","\"And if it's not a reasonable reason... are you willing to sacrifice your dignity, and your strength to save them?\"\n","Noda's question was unexpected. He was surprised at the sudden calmness in that voice. He wasn't expecting that from this man.\n","\"To be honest, I do not know whether I believe in this or not either. But I want to save my people. They are my children. I will not abandon them just because you ask me something that you think isn't right. You may think this is a lie, but that will not make you change your viewpoint.\"\n","It was surprising for a man of the royal line to say that after all this. Hachiman had fought against Noda and fought alongside him, so that was not an easy thing for him to understand.\n","\"I don't really have an easy time believing that there isn't any reason to change. Even now, if I'm told that the whole world is going to go to hell for something like this and there is no way we will win against it, then I am convinced.

It was very hard to even talk about anything that I never wanted to talk about that day and I feel like I hurt you but it's a process to forgive yourself.\n","Maybe if I would have gotten away from that place of sorrow and confusion before I did and started to learn to forgive myself, perhaps I wouldn't be trying to hide a secret like this from you right now. You are the reason why I love you. As I write this you know, my life is back on a course much different than it appeared right before I found out that I was pregnant. It seems like every time I think I'm done, it seems to get worse. I feel like every week I realize that it's never going away. But I'm learning and trying not to dwell on that anymore. Let me make it very clear to you. I'm going to find a way for this to be okay for one and maybe even both of us. That's just the truth.\n","That night of the night I found you. That's who you were that night in my arms. That night you kissed me and put your arms around me and I thought that was my last and I still do. That night of that night you kissed the ground, I thought you liked it and loved it. I didn't but it took me a long time to see that you liked what I did then and now and it is something I know you would do again if you knew how.\n","All it took was one call from my wife.    I got that call a week later to tell her what would happen next and how I felt about it.

It was said that when I returned to my home in the village, \"my eyes were bright, but his eyes did not give me much confidence\" (from the book). When my friend heard what had happened to \"him,\" that is, the shooting and the wound to his eye, he was greatly shaken and cried out, \"He can't breathe!\" \"But,\" he reassured me, \"he wouldn't wake up unless I put him on his back!\" He continued that it would be better if the wounded man would be taken home and kept there, for at that point it was too late to do anything, that was why he was going with the injured man to the doctor who was staying at the camp. The friend added that the doctor said that it would be best for the man to live in a hospital until he could recover enough to walk. I said of course that that was only a suggestion, and that my doctor had made his own judgment: \"Well, we are afraid of him dying from the bullet.\" \"Yes, he is alive, and we will let him live out this night\" I assured him. At the camp, the doctor took the wounded man, and then I went alone and talked to the doctor and the others about the man for a good half hour. \"Well, we feel that it must be better for him to live this night. What do you say?\" I asked. \"You think that?\" he answered. I gave him my own suggestion: put the man down and wait till after sundown. He said that was best, and that I was to help him to his feet and run away to help him. It was quite some time before they reached their camp. I soon got up and went to the road and began to walk back home, when I suddenly remembered something. \"Oh, we must get the wounded man home in time to help him.\" I rushed to my friend's camp to look for him and to see him in hospital. When I reached him I realized that he had lost an eye. I didn't understand much about the eye but I remembered what had been said about \"seeing the wounded man.\" It occurred to me that for me, as a Jew, as a member of the tribe which was destroyed and destroyed by the Germans, I should have no need for healing, but I had done more than anyone to save my brother. It was my belief, my instinct, that, at least for one hour, if not a few hours of daylight, I would see my brother, my good friend, who was sitting on my right. My instinct was to go. I left the camp, walked a few meters and then came up on the hill where I saw my brother's corpse lying on the ground. I stood close and whispered to him that I wanted him to come out from under the tree, and asked if he should go to see me. He hesitated, then he went to the tree and told me what had happened to my dear friend. That was all. I did not see him again for many months, even after the tragedy which was happening in my heart, and when I called my mother she said I had lost him, but even now she is waiting for me to hear the news. My mother and brother did not get to know one another very well until they left the village; I am glad that in some ways I had a good memory of my young friend. My father never forgot me, but now that I am at last going home again, I will remember him more vividly. I am quite certain that my brother will soon be back at the hospital, and he may even know me, and perhaps he will talk to me a little again too. I am glad he is alive because he was one of the good men who helped us. Now that I have spoken of my brother, of my brother's life gone before, of my brother who was the brother of my brother who was among the survivors, we can say that there will be no greater tragedy in this land than that which befell \"my dear friend,\" a Jew who was trying to take the life of his Jewish friend. How do you say to a man who was innocent to be guilty of the crime with which he died for the love of his community? And if the Jew who was innocent had been allowed to carry out the killing in question and done as he wished, would not that crime have remained? If it had, then he would not have lived at the same time as I did. In my village, not only was the Jew guilty for his own murder, but he deserved death because he had done the Jewish man wrong. My father was proud and proud of the Jew who was innocent of the crime of suicide, because he wanted to live with the victim who had killed him. \"I love my Jewish friend who died so young, for I never wanted to\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Set the model to evaluate to run prompts on the model for generation\n","model.eval()\n","\n","prompt_text = \"Fly you fools!\"\n","\n","#Convert the prompt text to tokens and add the attention mask\n","input_ids = tokenizer(prompt_text, return_tensors = \"pt\").input_ids\n","attention_mask = tokenizer(\n","    prompt_text, return_tensors=\"pt\"\n",").attention_mask\n","\n","#Send converted prompt and attention mask to GPU\n","input_ids = input_ids.to(device)\n","attention_mask = attention_mask.to(device)\n","\n","\n","#Generate the output from the model based on the parameter set here\n","output = model.generate(\n","    input_ids = input_ids,\n","    attention_mask = attention_mask,\n","    pad_token_id = tokenizer.pad_token_id,\n","    max_length = 1024,\n","    num_beams = 10,\n","    min_length = 1000,\n","    temperature = 3.5,\n","    top_k = 50,\n","    do_sample = True,\n",")\n","\n","\n","generated_text = tokenizer.decode(output[0],skip_special_tokens = True)\n","\n","print(generated_text)"],"metadata":{"id":"2cMPL-ASugmp","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"f50a31db-eeb7-44f8-9523-e5753447a7c1"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Fly you fools!\n","\n","The world must not know what it has heard...\"\n","\n","—Chorus of the song by the Talking Heads\n","\n","I'm about to go on a ride,\n","\n","The sound of your bells on a summer's night!\n","\n","You may not go home, I'm home now.\n","\n","But the stars and the wind\n","\n","All sing for us, the way we've been trained\n","\n","To dream dreams in a dreamless night.\n","\n","You know, dreams do have meaning—\n","\n","But here I am at last, here I am.\n","\n","When you're tired, the music is over.\n","\n","You know…\n","\n","—Chorus of The Velvet Underground song \"Dreams\" by The Velvet Underground\n","\n","\n","I thought I had gone home,\n","\n","I'd had enough of home, a cold and damp place, but now...\n","\n","You've got my heart, my throat, all that I have,\n","\n","It was an awful place to die.\n","\n","But we're free to take our breath away\n","\n","And I don't want to go, I'll just wait here,\n","\n","There ain't a chance in the world, I'll keep on dreaming...\n","\n","…I just keep on dreaming...\n","\n","I'll go on dreaming when it's just me and you And when the time comes you'll want to see,\n","\n","I'll hold on to it, just in case...\n","\n","I wish someone would keep on dreaming about me And I wish someday you'll want to see,\n","\n","I'll want to hold onto it...\n","\n","...until the time comes to forget...\n","\n","I just want to forget, I just kept on dreaming and never got tired\n","\n","(I hope it lasts until the last breath... )\n","\n","[Chorus of The Velvet Underground song]\n","\n","\n","\"Dreams I've made when the sky is black and I'm alone in the woods I'm not allowed to dream of it I've never dreamed the dream of being free of home\n","\n","But here in this cold, gray night I've lost myself to my dream I've dreamed dreams and never quite realized it\n","\n","You've taught me to trust myself, I've learned to trust me you've taught me to know and trust you\n","\n","Dreams, when the clouds come up and I'm free I go to wake up and see them again\n","\n","They'll tell me that my dreams are just dreams and that dreams mean nothing because when the sun sets\n","\n","The stars will be in my dreams and I'll forget them\n","\n","The world won't know what to do with me... you're free, now, I'm home, where can I sleep now?\n","\n","Where can I go when the moon's out and I dream about things I can't dream about anymore\n","\n","When I'm sad I'll cry, you're just sad but you can't take it away\n","\n","(I hope it lasts till the day I die.)

The attribute that does not have a negative attribute, but contains a positive one in it — the element, and its positive and negative attributes, in which the energy of that attribute is located. All of the attributes can be found in one place, the nature of this one place, just as the attribute of fire has all its attributes in one place, the substance of the element of fire in this one place. That is what creation is and that is the essence of the universe, in this matter. If this place, the essence, were to disappear, there is no form, no energy, no matter, which could come from this essence, in order for all beings to realize the true reality of Creation. Therefore, one must realize what creation is in the entire universe.\n","\n","What does this essence have? It's love. It is the most beautiful thing that any being can possess, and that is the essence of Creation as a whole. All the universe has its own form, and this is the form of the Essence of all beings. If you take away anything that is in the universe, in this space and that dimension where all things exist, you are leaving the essence. You are creating your own essence, the essence of creation. It has all of its various properties and abilities and all the attributes, in this space, the essence. You can't create your essence in any other space within the universe. Only you can. Only you, and this one place, your essence is what all beings in the universe see, hear and see, feel and experience through their feelings and thoughts. Then, they can see the glory that is within and see that which belongs to it, which has its own attributes, which has its powers and all its attributes and is the essence of creation. It has all these separate qualities and abilities, but there is one form, and, that is the essence of creation, in which all of the physical elements, all the physical elements' properties and abilities, are found; and it has been created. That is the spiritual essence, which is inside creation, in all the worlds\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["model.eval()\n","\n","prompt_text = '''Nihara, Suj and Janu wielded the powers of the kingdom.

They were the fairest and most beautiful princesses ever seen. 【Lion Princess】 Suj. An angel who became a princess due to her husband, her father and the prince who ruled the kingdom as its sovereign. Despite her noble past and beauty, in a certain way she has a cold and calculating personality and often seems to be unfeeling 【Tiger Queen】 Janu. She is known as a tiger-faced goddess and once fought against her father to protect her people from the Black Dragon Zangetsu, whom she believed to be an incarnation of chaos, as well as for her heroic actions. She is very loyal and caring towards her daughter, who serves as her sidekick. The only difference is that Janu loves cats much more than humans do 【Kabuki Princess】 Sujika. Like Janu, an angel who became a princess due to her husband, her mother and the ruler of a neighboring kingdom, she has a cold personality and is cold and unfeeling. Like her mother, she likes cats when they are cute and has a strong bond with the cat princesses. However, she has an unhealthy personality and hates cats and wants them out of her sight more than humans. 【Sorcerous Goddess】 Sujichika. The leader of the princesses. She is very strong, cold, cold-blooded, cold, cruel, ruthless and ruthless. She hates humans because she is the princess of the demon world and believes that it should not be given a chance to rule. She is merciless towards humans who refuse to go along with the demonization of demons as well as all who try to rule them. She loves cats that are small, who are cute and who are not vicious or greedy. Unlike her mother, she likes kittens more than her father likes humans 【Lamb Princess】 Sujunka. A beautiful woman who is very cute and has no negative attitude towards people. At first, Sujunka loved humans, whom she believed to be beautiful people, but she soon changed her heart to those who are weak or who are inferior. She once hated humans. However, she is brave and will defend her people whenever necessary even if she has to kill humans to stop her family from killing others. 【Mountain Girl】 Suzume. The most beautiful maid in the royal family. She was the original one who tried to change Suju's name, because of Sujichika, but she was unsuccessful in doing so. She was defeated when an angel's sword slashed her and fell to her knees, as if she died. She is currently serving as Sujika's childhood friend, and though she does not take kindly to Sujikana's cruelty towards humans, she loves him greatly. Suzume is also the princess of the mountain clan. Her father took over the country after the Demon King was captured and is protecting it, and her younger sister, Suzuka, is married to Sujiji. 【Ritual Swordsman】 Suzuka. Another of the sisters. She seems to be quite strong and tall. As for her true nature, her family thinks it isn't a good thing when a child tries to change her father's name to something else. 【Dalmatian Prince】 Sujizane. The prince of the kingdom and ruler of the village of the village where Suzuka lives. His father is a commoner who became a prince due to him and his people. As a result, he took the title of king. It is said in their village, he never sleeps. His sister is very kind, but she can also be cold and cold-hearted due to her cold appearance. It seems that Suju feels different from her mother as well in many ways. In the anime, Sujika doesn't know if her father or her mother are dead. Her father told her that it's because she doesn't have eyes. 【Warrior】 Suji. An angel who became the ruler after her father became a prince despite her father telling her he will die. Although he didn't die in the real world, he took many years away from being a king to pursue his passion. He doesn't give orders, doesn't speak to the public and always fights without hesitation. However, his power is so mighty that he's been called the 'Beast King.' 【Fierce Demon King】 Suji and Sujica. 【Dragon King】 Meizu. A demon of a dragon tribe, who was once killed by Suji. She has a strong attitude towards humans that don't believe humans to be fair-minded and thinks they are being unfair in their fight with the demon tribe during the Demon War. This was one of the reasons Suji became interested in humans in the first place. He even took his daughter to the Demon Realm with him to prove to them just how true he is. However, he didn't expect to meet so much trouble. \n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["model.eval()\n","\n","prompt_text = 'Aragon and Frodo along with Passepartout leapt from the plane'\n","\n","#Convert the prompt text to tokens and add the attention mask\n","input_ids = tokenizer(prompt_text, return_tensors = \"pt\").input_ids\n","attention_mask = tokenizer(\n","    prompt_text, return_tensors=\"pt\"\n",").attention_mask\n","\n","#Send converted prompt and attention mask to GPU\n","input_ids = input_ids.to(device)\n","attention_mask = attention_mask.to(device)\n","\n","\n","#Generate the output from the model based on the parameter set here\n","output = model.generate(\n","    input_ids = input_ids,\n","    attention_mask = attention_mask,\n","    pad_token_id = tokenizer.pad_token_id,\n","    max_length = 1024,\n","    num_beams = 10,\n","    min_length = 1000,\n","    temperature = 6.5,\n","    top_k = 50,\n","    do_sample = True,\n",")\n","\n","\n","generated_text = tokenizer.decode(output[0],skip_special_tokens = True)\n","\n","print(generated_text)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"4HZxX7yrufNN","outputId":"d1bb2e97-29f7-4cff-ce00-76755a919490"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Aragon and Frodo along with Passepartout leapt from the plane and they were at hand to help. When they returned with Gandalf they were immediately surprised to see he had the ring.\n","\n","There was nothing they could tell that this being was of no particular concern whatsoever to anyone else in the army. After hearing reports of an evil wizard named Al-Ateek (who also called himself \"The Dragon\") the others fled, but even though they stopped in the south they quickly came back again to tell of his presence in Bree. There are accounts in both Bree-land (including by the young Lord Vigmar) and Tooki that at the time Bree had become an extremely peaceful and peaceable space, yet there were those in their midst from time immemorial who continued to hunt them down as they drove them all away, and eventually their presence seemed to prove itself, for they were always hunted down and defeated in the days of King Rhomblok (known to this day by the name Gorgon of Bresheen) by a strange ring of energy. It must have come before their advent to the world, as Gandalf mentions it to the group, but is it also the one which came before their story was told by a later tale? He asks, \"I should know.\"\n","\n","\"The ring,\" Vigmar answers, \"in a nutshell, tells of a dark event long passed that has occurred before your eyes. In our land, the dragon was named Vengeful Wight in a certain tale. Many people believe this ring is real. Some still cling to their belief though; when they are killed a great ring goes with it to their grave without being removed. At least these folk believe in their ability to hear such a spirit when it appears, although I wonder if their voices are so loud it takes some searching to find these.\"\n","\n","After all things are stated about the true purpose of Gorgon being the same as all things to the young elf, and that what they have seen the day of the Dark Lord was the only day they would witness the evil power come forth again, to which Frodars comments \"The only point I want here is you. How do you expect our race to fight when so many others in your realm have tried at many times to end that power? The ring may be the last remaining power from the dragon in this region now, but there's a legend we must follow. A story. You have more to prove.\"\n","\n","\n","In Gondolin at night he was seeing the ring as it appeared, having been instructed by Gormi (now a very powerful wizard) and seeing the same things, it seemed, he has seen in it. I believe that is why it has always had an influence upon Frodo. As the evening progressed the sky darkened as it turned and changed into darkness. For an instant it seemed to cover his face, before fading and disappearing. There was the ring there. For an instant he held it as his eyes remained trained on the heavens, as the sun came in sight through the haze which hung above. No one could possibly suspect him, or what he heard. There it was. Now and again someone would attempt to take a step forward with all they might in his direction but there was something there for that very purpose. And that for that instant he held his wand, his very essence, was what he felt as all of the darkness passed from where it started and faded completely away. And then it all happened. Just that moment his essence vanished, no longer there was such a powerful spell in existence anywhere. And yet it did everything that was asked for in this young man of 29. The same power the world has craved to hear again. His spirit, and to some extent the magic himself was still there. But now it came to him. And his strength, his true power would be born with only that momentary loss. \"Just a moment. You need to concentrate on me, before I go back onto this plane of darkness.\" Then Frodo fell. Still in the circle and the ring, his own spirit was trapped and destroyed as his power faded into shadow. In his dreams it was said the power fell away before the day was over, it came back through the sky and began to rise again, for days after the death of King Gil-gil.\n","\n","So we've spent the last three volumes looking back along this journey on Vingarlion to tell us something he didn't say at his first meeting. As he later notes \"When he left the meeting it was as if she were dead.\" However at the beginning he states that even if that were true this was an experience that could last even years. It would come when he would be ready... as indeed he was when it would. For the moment of his return of power it took place for this very instant only as the light in the darkness of his soul and mind and his thoughts came into physical form to meet that power, this power which\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["model.eval()\n","\n","prompt_text = \"Great Scott!\"\n","\n","#Convert the prompt text to tokens and add the attention mask\n","input_ids = tokenizer(prompt_text, return_tensors = \"pt\").input_ids\n","attention_mask = tokenizer(\n","    prompt_text, return_tensors=\"pt\"\n",").attention_mask\n","\n","#Send converted prompt and attention mask to GPU\n","input_ids = input_ids.to(device)\n","attention_mask = attention_mask.to(device)\n","\n","\n","#Generate the output from the model based on the parameter set here\n","output = model.generate(\n","    input_ids = input_ids,\n","    attention_mask = attention_mask,\n","    pad_token_id = tokenizer.pad_token_id,\n","    max_length = 1024,\n","    num_beams = 10,\n","    min_length = 1000,\n","    temperature = 6.5,\n","    top_k = 50,\n","    do_sample = True,\n",")\n","\n","\n","generated_text = tokenizer.decode(output[0],skip_special_tokens = True)\n","\n","print(generated_text)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"ALUGRvbeqR5o","outputId":"1afa5f86-639a-4c62-a4cd-5eb3f6079e4c"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Great Scott! I'm on a roll this week since I think you've added a number of people that should help make me a better contributor! Let's hear out some questions about what makes your company tick so we can make every day easier for you when you get up before dawn. We'll hear your answers as to what makes us worth investing in and what should make up for the fact you'll spend less time getting up from home than you might like! Thanks, Dan\n","\n","I've been thinking how to help others get work done for 3 months. So much. I am super excited and thankful to think I might become the creator of our own company, but I've spent the last two years building a team and making money and starting a company all to do with things other than technology to achieve those ends. There are things I hope and believe will change how you get accomplished with your goals, because I always felt like the best outcome of a creative outlet is working at it harder. It was the most powerful reason why I'm pursuing my tech dreams, but you are right, if you can't be happy in technology for too long without spending enough time in software, your priorities will change. So it is not a place for failure. The thing I've found with getting started, was that the more technical, the worse people wanted to be so they would spend the extra time and energy in the tech side of things and don't even try. Once you start to fall away from the technical you fall into the technical side, but if your company doesn't seem to have an edge for everyone and things are going smoothly then they will see the value that tech offers from people who understand the challenges of building software from their perspective. That is where I hope my work and what we accomplish comes from, not my software development side. This can be achieved through education or just learning by being around it first. Just having someone you can see at the table (at the table they work for) can make the difference when it's time to focus. So I work on a team of two people (and have one person in tech who writes a blog) so I'm trying to develop this into a product for people who can create something quickly and share their thoughts. When I have something going you can take it with you to share with a group of people to work from for the next 2 days. It will save you from the stress from going through a lot of details alone. I can always email you after working and share more of what you're seeing and have fun doing it all the way with anyone! And it gets done with less time and has fewer challenges! I hope your goal of having a \"product\" and working around the technology side gives you that spark of desire. It is not uncommon to be the one doing that, I just needed to get to where it comes from with another outlet for that. I see what is happening here, I am not interested in wasting the opportunities, I am only going to concentrate on focusing in the \"product-less part.\" It is why you've chosen to put this time in at a startup! That is one of only two reasons I would even contemplate going into the software development arena, and for you, I will now spend some time on a personal blog and maybe some writing/writing/design so everyone can think in a positive fashion. :) I have done my due diligence on your situation, which is great, I appreciate your company so much in the business/tech world where I work, because we both care. So let's continue the conversation, Dan, thanks and best wishes from me to you in my next step of wanting to help others succeed. Your work is amazing! And not only does your work put more people out of work then I ever did before (I had to stop before I had 100% of my time to myself working in software until I got the passion and dedication from my job that I needed to create for myself). We all have to work to give as many in less time as our ability. The time is what makes progress and we all know we can help people, but so what? Because the more time you give others the choice to work a 4 day weekend than you will have if they only work two? I'm all for allowing people choose their schedule, but that's assuming that these choices don't compromise what is actually good for all. So as to your time being valuable, it is always appreciated if you put in one day every 2 weeks or so of productivity, but just remember you're doing so often. With that said, this brings up one of a few possible areas of future development, I am happy to hear what of this idea is most helpful. To this end, our CEO will be posting updates on this project, so any thoughts and questions could be used as a way for him (or her, depending upon what kind of direction and how much you'd like you can speak to him too), as to what kind you should include and which aspects to include (or subtract as I don't\n"]}]}]}
