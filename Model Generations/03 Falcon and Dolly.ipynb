Perhaps even something more. \n","\n","The planet Prairies was once a lush farming ground, but decades of war had turned it into a wasteland. Those who could afford it had left the planet, while the more poor people stayed behind to tend the crops. With war causing starvation, many of the population perished from lack of nutrients in the soil. \n","Upon the discovery of a new planet with abundant natural resources, many settlers arrived, but were quickly swallowed up by the newly found rich soils. All that was left was a small community of farmers who had managed to survive the years of drought and famine. \n","It had been many years since anyone had seen or heard from them, but no-one worried for the time being. \n","\n","When a visitor arrived on the planet, no-one knew quite what to expect. \n","\n","The first thing that struck fear into the hearts of the settlers was the sight of a giant predator looming over the land. Suddenly they saw more than just one massive beast; there were tens of them, flying overhead, landing and forming a massive perimeter around the village. \n","The inhabitants of the planet were at a loss for what to do. Although they could destroy the beasts, they didn't understand the threat that they posed. They could also try and communicate with the beast, but did not have the knowledge to do so. \n","When the first shock had passed, the predators began their hunt. After a while they noticed a lone human in the village, and they became very curious. \n","\n","They flew low over the village to find a hiding spot, but it was too late. The villagers had noticed the movement too. \n","A sharp knife was the last thing on the human's mind, but as one the beast approached he drew his weapon and took aim. \n","\n","The beast fell from the sky, unable to sustain its flight. When it hit the ground, the villagers noticed something very odd. The beast had transformed itself into something altogether different. \n","The creature seemed to have been reduced in size and was now standing on the spot it had stood a few moments before. It was no longer a giant. It was smaller and now appeared almost human. The villagers were speechless. \n","The creature slowly approached the human, who clearly remembered seeing it fly. \n","\n","The human stood his ground and said the first thing that came to mind. \"We don't know your language. Can you help us?\"\n","\n","The creature slowly smiled, and seemed to speak the human language perfectly. The creature asked the humans a series of questions. \n","\n","The creature looked at the villagers and asked: \"Do you know these people?\" The villagers nodded. \n","\n","The creature asked another question: \"Are they friends or enemies?\" The humans were confused. The creature explained: \"You invaded my territory. I came to retaliate.\"\n","\n","The villagers asked: \"What do you mean?\" The creature told them: \"The planet is rich. We both can benefit from trading. I'll let you live if you let me go.\"\n","\n","The villagers thought about this for a few minutes. They had never heard of such a thing. The only way to survive in this situation was to save their own skins, and perhaps even the humans, but the threat still loomed large. \n","\n","The villagers made a decision. \n","\n","\"Very well, we can trade. What would you want in exchange?\" The creature didn't reply. \n","\n","The villagers asked: \"Are you telling us that you won't agree to our terms unless we give you something in return?\" \n","The creature suddenly spoke up: \"My ship is waiting out there. Let's talk about the deal later.\" \n","\n","The creature then took the human's hand and dragged him from the village. \n","\n","The villagers watched the scene unfold with shock. As the human was taken from the village, a bright light lit up the sky. The light was approaching fast, and the villagers had no time to react. \n","\n","The creature led the humans out of the village and towards the light. \n","\n","The creature was no longer interested in trading. They had a new goal to achieve. It was clear to all that the human was going to be destroyed. The creature just wanted to feel the fear of the human before they suffered the same fate.\n","\n","ÃÂÃÂ\n","\n","  The human was taken from the village, a bright light lit up the sky, and the villagers had no time to react.\n","\n","ÃÂ\n","\n","  The creature led the humans out of the village and towards the light.\n","\n","ÃÂ\n","\n","  The creature was no longer interested in trading.

It is like nothing you have ever seen. A few hours later you are joined by a beautiful red-headed humanoid alien, she introduces herself as Kara. She explains that she is the mission leader for the colony, and that you, her human companion, are her liaison. Together you set off to discover what strange new world this is. \n","\n","At first you explore the old town. It is pretty, full of books and artifacts from a lost civilisation, you spend a lot of your time exploring this, reading signs and learning the local lingo. As you explore you learn that there is more to the town than meets the eye. For instance, there seems to be more wildlife in the town than is sustainable, and the locals appear to have some kind of gene therapy to enhance their looks, or so it seems. \n","\n","It isn't long before Kara is bored with the old town, it is not very exciting, she longs for the hustle and bustle of the city. So you set off for the city. You make it to the city, and you begin to explore. You are not prepared for the strange new world you discover. The city is awash with money, money that appears to be flowing out of the city into the surrounding countryside. You stumble upon a strange underground casino, and it is here you meet the croupier, a cute, petite alien with razor sharp teeth. \n","\n","You strike a deal and the croupier bonds with you. She shows you all her hidden secrets, revealing more and more of the sinister game being played. In the end it all comes down to a simple question of greed. You pay and she bonds. As she leaves with the money, she offers to show you around her place. You follow her through the brightly lit streets, and suddenly you realise where you are. It is not the old town, it is not the city, it is not reality, it is a game, a gigantic matrix like game, and you've walked into the middle of it. The game's masters are watching, and they have made you their next sacrifice.\n","\n","\n","From there it all just gets better. The game masters become even more powerful, and you find yourself caught in a battle between good and evil. Good wants to protect the fragile balance of the universe, and so they send in an army to destroy the evil.

There wasn't even any snow on the ground, it was just a little crispy in places.\n","\n","The twins were woken by their parents on the Sunday morning.

They both heard the manager say, \"It can't be. They have stolen our technology\" just before the phone went dead.\n","\n","The Armstrongs heard the words \"cyberattacks\" and \"Kaspersky\". Two days later their laptop wouldn't turn on. It had not been tampered with - the only data was the history of the call, in real time.\n","\n","The manager was fired immediately and the call was classified as \"a significant data breach\".

Shortly thereafter, the twins, Gavin and Avery, wander into the hotel foyer, where they are alarmed by the manager and security staff rushing around.

There had been few warriors since the time of the King's death, and now very few of them were left. Nihara was just fourteen, but she had been learning the ways of war since she was eight, when the King had made her a warrior for the first time. Even now, she wanted to be someone who could show off to the other soldiers at the King's court. To make up for her lack of experience, she made herself up a few stories of her own.\n","\n","-She could often be found playing around the castle or in a fight arena, sword in hand. She had earned a reputation as a mighty fighter in these battles, so the King had made her a leader of his own guards, with charge of a few ships in his fleet. She was popular among her men, who looked up to her with respect. She didn't try to keep the men at a distance, and they all were always in love with her. Many of them also started to be warriors so they could stay close to their beloved princess. Nihara herself did not think of the men who worked with her as she called them \"brothers\", but she knew that if she asked the King, he would give his consent for a few of them to become knights.\n","\n","-Nihara was a little nervous at the mention of knighthood. She didn't have the same rank as the King's sons but in her own way, she also was a part of the Kingdom's elite. She also had a dream, a few of her own stories she had to tell, although she had to keep it all hidden for now. Her own father was still alive and the King liked her to learn a little of the male's work. There were also rumors that the last of the King's daughters were born with magic wands, in the same way his sons were the first kings of the kingdom. This also meant he wanted the female wands to carry on for the kingdom's legacy.\n","\n","-Nihara would not be able to attend the King's Royal College like the rest of his sons, so the King sent her down to his own castle for the last year of her education. There she met her teacher-a wizard who had been in the castle for many years. She was a strange person, a mix of a scholar, a warrior and a wizard. Her hair was long and her face was angular. She had been in the castle longer than Nihara, but she had become an advisor to the King, not the King himself. She used to tell her stories that would fill the hall with stories from the deep sea tales, knights and knights being sent out as a guard and the adventures of a princess.\n","\n","-\"To call this a story is like calling a lion a pet cat.\" Said the wizard.\n","\"Well, how would you like to call the story?\" Answered Nihara. She had been practicing her own forms of story telling-mostly ones from fables-for a while, but she had never heard such a thing. What she did have to do now is practice a few words without letting the wizard know.\n","The wizard smiled, \"A fine story, your highness. Let me know if there is anything else you want to share with yourself before I can answer any of my own questions.\n","Nihara had found her dream-her own way of being with her father. She still went on quests, battles, fought for the Kingdom and most of all, she had gone home.\n","-When Nihara was fourteen, a few of her men had come into a fight at school. Soon, she realized that the ones she used to look up to were in fact, the ones to challenge for the fight. With the King's favor, the Princess won with ease, and defeated all his opponents and even the King himself. The King and the Princess walked out to the garden together, and the King thanked her for saving her Kingdom again.\n","\n","-Nihara bowed in front of the King and thanked him for his love. Although he now felt it was a bit too late and she would probably soon be married and then would probably have a daughter or two. A few years later, the King would pass away.\n","\n","-After he passed away, Nihara's mother called in the family to live in the main castle of the Kingdom.

They went from being mere acquaintances to having a special bond.\n","\n","As the years went on, Thomas and Sarah wrote stories to each other. They kept them in their respective journals until Thomas could no longer keep up.

It was during those years that Thomas and Sarah made their greatest strides as writers.\n","\n","And years after, as they both finally settled down, Thomas and Sarah remained closer than ever. But it wasn’t just because they were great friends; instead, it was because they were the kind of soulmates who shared a mutual understanding. They were the kind who could finish a sentence just by sharing a look. They were the kind who could go in long tangents because they were already so alike.\n","\n","But Thomas and Sarah were also very different. She was from Whipsnott while he came from a town out west. While she was a student at a prestigious university in Europe, Thomas was studying at the local community college. The only thing they had in common was their love of storytelling.\n","\n","But as they remained close, the bond between them only got closer. They found that their stories matched up almost perfectly; except that they both had something different to offer each other. \n","\n","Thomas was the perfect poet.

They had to go on a dangerous mission to get him to finish it, and he needs help to do this. I soon realize that I am more involved than I thought, and as Andersson tells me in the dark, secretive world to which he belongs, I must embark on a daring rescue mission to save an innocent man and get some answers about the government's secrets.\n","\n","As the weeks pass, I learn more and more about the project. It seems like there are multiple levels of government secrecy surrounding it. I find out I'm not the first person to be approached about the mission or the first one to be recruited.

It seems this program existed to colonize a new planet, and that planet was right here on earth. The government has been secretly colonizing people from that planet for years, and they finally want Andersson's rocket to finish the mission. \n","\n","You set about getting the rocket and the colonization project ready, but this time you're the one who is leading the mission. When the government contacts you, make sure that your communications are secure; you know how to fly the rocket and you have the necessary supplies. After a brief battle with enemy\n"]}]}]}
