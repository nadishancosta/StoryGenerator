adventurer from the east would certainly have been unable to remain here beyond the designated time—a period of nearly forty hours—and that, at any rate, by going on directly to Paris—the route taken would probably not have proved feasible for a more extensive tour than this one, taking in London from Portsmouth, Southampton, Liverpool, Birmingham, Manchester, Dublin, Glasgow, New York, San Francisco, and Singapore.” Milady therefore remained in her cabin for nearly an hour; then, leaning upon a large cushions armchair, which reflected the reflected rays of the sun from the windows of her cabin admiringly, she reflected a few more thoughts and slept, as one sleeps in a glass in the chamber of the Musketeers in the Louvre; and this, satisfied that every moment was precious, she made her way to her stateroom and fell into an easy chair with the lights burning in it as before, enveloped in her thoughts such as would terminate in nothing except to sleep, and which, in this sleep, so much the less suited her to be of great service to anybody but the person who placed an earnest and important request upon her as an Englishman who had crossed an ocean in the name of France, since she had been in England only one day and only on the first of an absolutely new journey, having embarked at Portsmouth, a journey so difficult and so entirely different from that started by her as she was setting out at this extraordinary period of English civil unrest upon a strange continent with a language and customs quite unfamiliar to her at this unfamiliar and terrible period—a journey, doubtless destined, in short, to make her some new friendships and meet with people whom she had not hitherto met and who were not, as on earth, familiar with her real interests or those she did not yet consider her friends, but friends solely on paper, because on paper they had not the power to affect her deeply and who only knew her by whom she was dealing, the cardinal, her jailer, her courtiers, those men whom she had arrested in England as spies, those men who had betrayed her to the English, the great intriguers of Europe, those assassins of which history speaks—the _carte blanche_—arguably all that remained to Milady could be decided upon by that drowsy quality to which everybody, in the midst of life, is accustomed, however well he might know whom he was dealing with, whether of men or men of affairs, a matter of intrigue in which the brain is easily susceptible, in short, a sop or a droll maneuver, and so to speak, more easily performed than with men in the higher branches of knowledge or those in which it excels—which, as the saying goes here, consists chiefly of the superficial part of intellectual development—and that drowsy quality, being of a highly personal character, is naturally less marked on those who are not themselves its victims but those whose protection attaches them to a powerful and loyal benefactor or protector, the great and terrible benefactor or the great antagonist, whom a courtier, as D’Artagnan was, or rather a general as the Comtesse de Wardes, represented, represented by an English man, a cardinalist as Louis XIII., or in another language like German, a detective, a spy as the Italian emigre de Soubise, or a _carte blanche_ as Mme unprovene—an active man, an active and avaricious man who, although his activity had been hitherto so low that, in those days, like all soldiers, he kept his reserve, he had now acquired the confidence of all, wherever his ranks were on earth, had plunged himself upon an idea of taking vengeance which would be horrible to even the worst minds in the eyes of a prudent man, had he not had, to a very simple idea of avenging himself, by an overthrow of his most intimate friend and of ruining himself thus the most venerated personage in a whole host of respectable houses on earth, for reasons infinitely more pressing than for personal vengeance alone! “Well, if you have comprehended the feelings of the poor girl who, following on this vengeance inspired by an inward antipathy toward the cardinal (and I can comprehend that passion for the head of the king is still greater than any other feeling, whether it be personal or social), having discovered that the cardinal had obtained the order for his arrest in his letter to his chancellor and had obtained orders to conduct him hither, what would you think if, instead of pursuing this woman to the gates of Paris, you had waited until the cardinal himself gave his consent? The very thoughts of our enemies would run riot in reading of this! What would become of our cardinal, if I had been exiled to the depths of his heart! Who would be permitted to know my secret if it were discovered at the very moment of the execution of the order to arrest me? In all things—in all times—had the cardinal succeeded in his mission\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Set the model to evaluate to run prompts on the model for generation\n","model.eval()\n","\n","prompt_text = \"The girl had a dream of flying\"\n","\n","#Convert the prompt text to tokens and add the attention mask\n","input_ids = tokenizer(prompt_text, return_tensors = \"pt\").input_ids\n","attention_mask = tokenizer(\n","    prompt_text, return_tensors=\"pt\"\n",").attention_mask\n","\n","#Send converted prompt and attention mask to GPU\n","input_ids = input_ids.to(device)\n","attention_mask = attention_mask.to(device)\n","\n","\n","#Generate the output from the model based on the parameter set here\n","output = model.generate(\n","    input_ids = input_ids,\n","    attention_mask = attention_mask,\n","    pad_token_id = tokenizer.pad_token_id,\n","    max_length = 1024,\n","    num_beams = 10,\n","    min_length = 1000,\n","    temperature = 3.5,\n","    top_k = 50,\n","    do_sample = True,\n",")\n","\n","\n","generated_text = tokenizer.decode(output[0],skip_special_tokens = True)\n","\n","print(generated_text)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"5WnaAreSubBg","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1704282438221,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":45066,"user":{"displayName":"Mahamuge Dinendra Costa","userId":"17358276780992758429"}},"outputId":"3130d0cd-98a7-4eca-89a1-621110c4e1b7"},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["The girl had a dream of flying, which was so intense that in the sleep of the young woman all her strength was still in her; so she was driven to drink, and fell into a passion of passion, for she could not rest until all the wine ran out of her, for she had a precious thing to take from the king, and it was now getting into the bottom of her stomach to stretch out some on her bed, as she slept with one hand on the edge of it, and with the other seizing the boy and pulling him down, dragged him into the sack where the pigeons were hanging to dry, while the fire was kindling to keep them warm in the hope that when they should die they should be able to sit still and be of great service to her father, the queen, or the king himself—all that she wanted was, to sleep with the sexton, and he to cook her supper and feed the chickens, and, in order to accomplish all this, she kept on pouring wine in her glass, until the bottom was completely covered; and then she let the boy fall again into the sack, and slept quite soundly and soundly, until, in the middle of the next day, it might be said that she had gotten the whole barrel, and lived a good while in the sack and the ale-house without any fear or want of rest, thinking that the dragon would be pleased with her and would be always looking on from his tower on Falada Hill looking about for her whenever any one of her friends who was about to set foot there, and thus tempted by her beauty and love of life, might be thought to be approaching her at that hour, and might be sure that she could not be held back or disturbed by the dragon’s ravens; and so she lived quite quietly and soundly a long time till she was pretty well married to her life, and looked upon beauty and love with much wonder; and at length when her father saw her sitting by herself, and thinking what she had worked so hard for, he thought she was a lucky charm or a great love, and said, ‘Tell me all about it, and I will make you into a beautiful thing, and I will give you what you deserve in the sight of all the world.’ But when the girl had gone to bed, she fell asleep very gently, while the sexton who was with her was still laying himself across the barrel from her, and listened to her; and when he did not tell her anything at all, she sprang up, threw herself upon the boy’s shoulders, and kissed him, and slept like a beautiful sleeping princess; and then her heart grew light and her spirit revived, and she dreamed that the king would come to take away the beautiful maiden, and bring her before him in his golden cage; and then the prince had the golden cage fastened around her, and he could not get the bird out; and as it was very hot and very early in the night she was sitting in the court-room, and as the king was about to drink the ale, and see the princess sitting by her side upon the golden cage, the golden cage flew up and shut the door; and shut the window as before it fell; and the golden cage hung upon the thorns of a tree, and was very warm to the sight in it; and at last the king got a glass of it and ate it; but the fox crept up underneath and stole it away, and it made him very thirsty and thirsty too; so he said, ‘Well, wife, how do you do this? does your heart taste? or does your stomach still lie open? or is your mind still wild with passion?’ But when the girl awoke up, and found the bird in the stomach, and was going to try and take it away from the golden cage again, her heart gave way and said, ‘Heaven be praised! you have got a taste of it; take it in; you shall have it now, for it is the only thing to save your life; and if you eat of it, God will punish you for your sin.’ At last the queen ordered the boy’s skin to be cut off, and put it into the goose, and as the girl was a very clever cook, she went and cut the skin into pieces and cut the skin until it was only a little bit skin, and sprinkled the bird with salt and the wine over it; and thereupon the prince put the skins on and drank the wine in the hope that he might get some rest and sleep; but to his great wonder, all the magic of the spell was done; for it seemed to him like an old fox had fallen asleep on a certain castle before him, and was about to come back into the castle to steal his supper; for he thought that the king was about to retire home to take his honey with him.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Set the model to evaluate to run prompts on the model for generation\n","model.eval()\n","\n","prompt_text = \"The dragon roared mightily\"\n","\n","#Convert the prompt text to tokens and add the attention mask\n","input_ids = tokenizer(prompt_text, return_tensors = \"pt\").input_ids\n","attention_mask = tokenizer(\n","    prompt_text, return_tensors=\"pt\"\n",").attention_mask\n","\n","#Send converted prompt and attention mask to GPU\n","input_ids = input_ids.to(device)\n","attention_mask = attention_mask.to(device)\n","\n","\n","#Generate the output from the model based on the parameter set here\n","output = model.generate(\n","    input_ids = input_ids,\n","    attention_mask = attention_mask,\n","    pad_token_id = tokenizer.pad_token_id,\n","    max_length = 1024,\n","    num_beams = 10,\n","    min_length = 1000,\n","    temperature = 3.5,\n","    top_k = 50,\n","    do_sample = True,\n",")\n","\n","\n","generated_text = tokenizer.decode(output[0],skip_special_tokens = True)\n","\n","print(generated_text)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"DD5E6kiNud-1","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1704282483036,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":44821,"user":{"displayName":"Mahamuge Dinendra Costa","userId":"17358276780992758429"}},"outputId":"4bac63c8-d6a3-45f3-cd8f-624f0631d826"},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["The dragon roared mightily, and shook the tree with fright, and cried:  ‘My lady, get down, and let each her drop of blood flow,   Let the dead rise from their tombs,   And let the young ones come,  Whom the wicked dead do carry   And lead nightly home with their bones.’ But the lady would not, so the dragon took her in his arms and held her a great way off till he came to a large hall where all the work of the world was going on; and at the door stood a large golden chair for the old king’s table; and when he had sat there a long while, the bird sat upon him, and took the seat next to him, and said kindly to him:  ‘Glad you are well, my lady, but where is the queen?   Will you kindly tell her, where is she?’ ‘Ah, wife,’ said the prince, ‘she is in her chamber at the other side of the castle;   I am sure it is she that is to come today.’ ‘O, wife!’ said the tree, ‘take her there and fetch her;’ and the lady put her upon the golden chair, took off her golden dress, and put it on, and slipped into the petticoat,  And sat down by her window and shut the golden shutters.’ So the woodman did likewise: and as the prince was going out he called to the woodman:  ‘Take her for the princess; tell her that she is a fine princess,   And a clever one too!’ But the woodman answered: ‘I know it was you that were the true bride;   But I am afraid she is not well; take her away from me to an infernal place,   And put her under the dragon’s skin and skin her very well.’ Then he called and cried at the door again, and cried so loud that it rang as far away as the hills, as the branches shook; but the dragon was standing there alone, and would not let him in, for he knew the woodman’s voice well; so when he called once more: ‘Thou comical fellow!’ all the work was undone, and the tree fell down dead, and the lady ran thither and shut the window; but as soon as the prince got out the prince ran home, and climbed the high wall and shut the door behind him, that he might never see the lady again; so the kingdom was ruled by a king and queen who had a beautiful palace in the woods, and lived there ever after as happy as if nothing had happened, though the princess had never been able to go into the court, or open the door against anyone’s desire, for there the princesses danced and danced; and the king liked the company well enough; so the king married her, and they lived happily together a long time, and had great and great treasures in their treasures: and the old king loved to see and take care of them: and was so much loved by both of them: and so they had many beautiful children, that they kept the princess company and kept the golden bird from them ever after as long as he was alive: and still loved them: so when the old king died he was led to an old tower where no one ever went in but was invited once a week: so the princess came there once and laid her kerchief over herself, and fastened the door inside; and when the young princes came in they were just as happy with the little princess as when they had left her: and when the old king looked at them the prince wanted to go in, but they would not, and his heart was so heavy, that his hand was frozen, that he would not let the princess go in: and they were so sad at having lost him that they fell asleep in the tower: and when the wedding was held the prince asked the princess to come down again to him that he might rest in peace: so she took off the golden necklace, and laid it on him to warm himself up: then when the bride saw that she could warm him no longer she let him go: and as he did so she began to feel a great pain in his head, so that his heart could no longer keep up with the warm: so she put the golden necklace into the ring, and the prince could warm himself no longer; and they took him in to a physician: and he took one of his golden stars, and was so glad that he did not want to come back in his usual dress; and they laid him on a chair, and his heart still kept up with it a great way off from home: so he was led away again to the country, and there they kept him very long;

The young officer, who had never yet been in a dangerous situation, had determined to make himself master of it; but he had scarcely looked at the young officer, whom he was to serve as his guard until he was dressed as one of the knights of his country, and was introduced to the hôtel which the cardinal had furnished him with for the purpose—or rather on the occasion of serving—as a part-time valet—and the conversation between the two men had already been interrupted by a noise of blows from the street and from a violent scuffle between their adversaries, when suddenly a flash of anger, which might have been a sign from the street, enlightened D’Artagnan, fixing his eyes upon a man in black who approached the door of the hôtel, endeavoring to pull away the Musketeer from Porthos, and looking with some uneasiness, as if by means of an invisible pin, at a servant, who held him by the arm in a threatening way, to whom he seemed to address himself for some moment with a question which, however ill directed, threw a ray of light upon his projects, and so darkened his appearance at once that the cardinal was obliged to acknowledge to him the title of a more discriminating observer than he really deserved from a man whose character and conduct were very divergent in character and a master of intrigues whom he was to regard as something more than a mere servant and whom the cardinal was to regard as something less than a man whom the king, after having branded with his sword, required to be always at hand, had a right to judge by the sword, or rather on the heels of which he was placed—a man who, it must be confessed, was like a master of disguise who makes himself master of one part by his great genius, but who always makes himself master by means of means of the obscurity of his means, sometimes at the risk of being detected; but above all—and here, for this remark appeared to be well founded—D’Artagnan was determined to destroy the evil magic which threatened to destroy her, even when that destruction was threatened by an enemy who, by the light of her light, might be detected by a woman so much superior in strength and beauty that she was never suspected by the less powerful man and, as a rule, was always able to subdue her whenever she could be led by force to a sword thrust—who was, as he expressed it, a man possessed by demons and possessed of an irresistible will, an envious spirit, who loathed all those who bore him ill, and who offended him by words and by gestures, and who dreaded all those who opposed him, because one of the two passions which divided the human species, cowardice and avarice, was his chief weapon against the one of courage, an invincible will which alone could destroy him, a sentiment which every human being must, under the conditions of his captivity, abandon with great difficulty to his will and to the villain whom he had made himself the instrument of his overthrow; and above all, a kind of revenge which made him tremble when he perceived an obstacle to his plans or when a road to victory presented itself before him, a wish for vengeance which, according to the most cynical physiognomist, could have no other cause than that of a physical deformity which, by degrees, though it existed, destroyed its victims by degrees over the heads of their victims, which the less active and less courageous would not even attempt to conquer by force; but this vengeance, whatever it might be, the cardinal did not permit to wander beyond the borders of his policy, and would have nothing to do till the moment of his triumph, when, after having killed the evil genius, he turned his sword around again to the genius of evil, a wish which made the heart beat violently in every oppressed person, and which, on the contrary, almost always found its justification in the most austere hatred, even by the most heartless and pitiless men! The expression of this hope in every heart was as if it had occurred in a man who, deprived of anything to save his own advantage and the sword, might have said to himself that this great desire would be satisfied, but who could not find anything to gratify it but a desire for a martyrdom—a sentiment, besides, in which the cardinal, whose genius was so lofty and his hatred so dreadful, had at least one means in his service, that of avengeance.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["model.eval()\n","\n","prompt_text = \"The bear gently cared for the wounded soldier\"\n","\n","#Convert the prompt text to tokens and add the attention mask\n","input_ids = tokenizer(prompt_text, return_tensors = \"pt\").input_ids\n","attention_mask = tokenizer(\n","    prompt_text, return_tensors=\"pt\"\n",").attention_mask\n","\n","#Send converted prompt and attention mask to GPU\n","input_ids = input_ids.to(device)\n","attention_mask = attention_mask.to(device)\n","\n","\n","#Generate the output from the model based on the parameter set here\n","output = model.generate(\n","    input_ids = input_ids,\n","    attention_mask = attention_mask,\n","    pad_token_id = tokenizer.pad_token_id,\n","    max_length = 1024,\n","    num_beams = 10,\n","    min_length = 1000,\n","    temperature = 3.5,\n","    top_k = 50,\n","    do_sample = True,\n",")\n","\n","\n","generated_text = tokenizer.decode(output[0],skip_special_tokens = True)\n","\n","print(generated_text)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"2sKrOpttuf8V","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1704282716857,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":46342,"user":{"displayName":"Mahamuge Dinendra Costa","userId":"17358276780992758429"}},"outputId":"2733eb6f-6860-42dd-8070-0eb639c405d6"},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["The bear gently cared for the wounded soldier, washed his face and hands, took the bandages from his neck, and led him along some hundred steps towards the forest where the princesses had hidden their young prince, as white as snow and as red as blood, and seated himself by the hearth among the ashes with a fire in his hand, grumbling ‘How miserable life be in the world!’ The manikin led the fox towards the princesses, opened a door, and led them into his house, where Snowdrop lay still, but prettily dressed and as white as blood, as white as snow had never been seen by the fox before, but still prettily dressed and as red had been already when she went with him thither with her protector from her father into the world to seek his father’s lost sword, ‘Here you shall sit and rest awhile,’ cried he; ‘I have something else to do, and shall take care of the housework; take care of it as you pleased, I must go home myself before my task is done, and not let anyone come in until it has been done’; and away they went over to the old fox’s house: when they had entered it, they could hear the dog chirping and howling, and saw through the gap in the roof the old raven sitting on the hearth and grumbling to himself sorrowfully that he had let Snowdrop into the world and the wedding was not soon after, but so soon as they had gone away the wedding was at an end for him and all his descendants, and there he was again, happily married and happy as ever was seen by the handsome little manikin’s housewife, and the foxes and the ravens flew joyously about and visited him in their old ways as still prettily as ever they had done, taking care no one could tell they had come at all from the golden castle: and there he sat happily and happily married, with his wife and his daughter at his side, thinking how glad they were to be married and still alive; and all the clocks indicated a pretty long time for the marriage and the wedding was to take place, so soon as the time was ripe; and when they came to it, and the wedding was almost over, the bride said happily to the lion: ‘What can I do at all, when I know that the wedding is a snare and no one passes through here but me who is called the prince?

so the prince went into the castle and ordered the maid to bring a beautiful bird out, and told her the way to get it back, the maid had gone out of her way in order that she might not be seen by anyone for the whole year: but after the maid had gone outside the palace the prince called out and said: ‘Shall I come back to see her too?’ but the maid answered: ‘No, no; the prince has sent someone to bring it\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["model.eval()\n","\n","prompt_text = \"The earthshaker beat his drum fiercely.\"\n","\n","#Convert the prompt text to tokens and add the attention mask\n","input_ids = tokenizer(prompt_text, return_tensors = \"pt\").input_ids\n","attention_mask = tokenizer(\n","    prompt_text, return_tensors=\"pt\"\n",").attention_mask\n","\n","#Send converted prompt and attention mask to GPU\n","input_ids = input_ids.to(device)\n","attention_mask = attention_mask.to(device)\n","\n","\n","#Generate the output from the model based on the parameter set here\n","output = model.generate(\n","    input_ids = input_ids,\n","    attention_mask = attention_mask,\n","    pad_token_id = tokenizer.pad_token_id,\n","    max_length = 1024,\n","    num_beams = 10,\n","    min_length = 1000,\n","    temperature = 3.5,\n","    top_k = 50,\n","    do_sample = True,\n",")\n","\n","\n","generated_text = tokenizer.decode(output[0],skip_special_tokens = True)\n","\n","print(generated_text)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"LHlOu82Vufup","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1704282762942,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":46091,"user":{"displayName":"Mahamuge Dinendra Costa","userId":"17358276780992758429"}},"outputId":"0efd735b-cb1a-4ffc-eac0-c9862c9e4e9d"},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["The earthshaker beat his drum fiercely.” “And how did you get that idea?” asked Pooh, as soon as he had recovered from his initial fear and begun to realise the full import of what had been said, in such a thoughtful, curious voice that I had not been sorry to interrupt him for a minute, and to bring him up to our own time by telling the whole history of the island from its arrival by Christopher Columbus on the Lofoten group, to our great disaster at the hands of the monsters of the White Sphinx, and then to the present moment, when the great artificial machine has made all our lives depend upon its inexhaustible energy and its wonderful intelligence alone.” Christopher Robin scratched his chin, as if he had heard something rather exciting, and rubbed his whiskers, as if to make himself more expressive, as he sat staring in silence in the midst of his ornamental pot of gold, and looked curiously at the clock on the mantelpiece of his own house, with its yellow border and gilt-edged dials, in which the days were listing steadily away like so many years in a year and years towards a mere century and a half below the present._] But I must be brief, for we are not here to judge what people are good at doing, particularly not before we have lived long enough to know whether we are doing it well or badly, or whether, whatever our personal faults and follies, we are doing things honourable or disgraceful to those around us, or doing things wicked and foolishly to those who are supposed to cherish and guard us, or at least to those who wish to destroy and steal from us whenever and wherever there is money to be had or treasure to be gained, and noxious weeds or scum to be poached, or men to be slain, and the like petty vices to which a savage may expose himself and others upon the world’s surface, and no sense of the harm to those who do these things but to ourselves and to those we serve, and when we are caught and shut up up in a dungeon or on some ship or iron cage and are forbidden to talk of ourselves or of those we serve, how could we judge what our master is doing, when we know nothing of what is passing at home and no notion whatever of what he says to his friends or his inferiors? And what on earth has happened to him since these events took place? What have his friends done? Who has taken his place at these public events? No one knows; and yet there I was, wondering and wondering, and wondering with the curiosity that only fever makes us, as I watched and observed the procession of people who came and set out from his house for an evening stroll on the very beach where they were to gather, as I went out to look at the birds in the harbour and the people flocking thenceward to their work and play; and marveling to myself when Owl, who was running about the streets outside with a balloon in one hand and a tin can in the other, sang out in that harmonious voice and sang, in a kind of old song, as he took his place across the stream from his front gate into the little room where his friends were sitting together, and sang:  “Dear friends! My house is on fire,      But you are safe inside, and the world is safe beyond!” And every now and then there seemed to be a spark of flame spreading itself in the air, or a glint of flame dancing slowly across the water as the dawn was breaking, and that was what it was that made me smile and clung to the fire and kept me warm in the moonlight, for it seemed as though the world itself had come alive and was dancing in the flame, and suddenly there was a tumbling of branches and flowers and all that glittering multitudinous green and silver and crimson and luminous green that came to life in the stillness and colouring of the twilight around me and crept nearer and nearer as I watched, and now and then there was a little hesitation and then a rolling of leaves or the clink of an owl, and every now and then there was a sudden thud as there was a movement of air and light in the house through the open window, and then a flash of gold and a soft tap at the door; and sometimes one of the men in the black hood would start in the moonlight from the house and dash to and away with a glass, or perhaps a bow and a pistol, like a dog, as he might be in a dog’s ear, or a wolf’s paws, or a cat would leap up and throw down a gold coin on the face of the duke and dash it to bits as he was passing in the street; and every now and then a little twinkle or a ripple of gold seemed to flash across the sky and a flash of silver, and then\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["model.eval()\n","\n","prompt_text = 'The great warrior Nihara unsheathed her sword and cried out: \"How dare you hurt my bubs!

The giant sewed him up and he was soon in the shape of the old Japanese fable where the bird is the beast and the mouse the child and the cow is the lamb; and when he had been put into the mouth of the well and drank, it was to say ‘Goodbye for ever and ever and never’ to the bubs, never to her, but whenever he wished, as was his kind custom, to rise from his well to tell the princess how very thankful he was that she had kept her promise and not gone into the well and let her get the medicine instead, for when he had said all this, she jumped into bed and lay still, and never once stirred from her slumber; and the soldier was forced to keep watch, and when it was morning she was to be led away, and the cook to take her away every morning and not let her go to any part of the castle or the garden, nor to sleep in a lonely corner of the palace, for in that way the old stories were kept up, in other words they were fables that kept people up in the most ridiculous and idiotic fashion; for in this manner everything that was once told was kept perpetually repeated, even if it no longer stood in the strict sense of fact, and so it was always twilight before the sun had come up, or morning before the maid had done her dirty work, and everything that was once said and done fell into the very bargain, if at all, that the princess and maid could get hold of, and so be continually reminded of the bargain whenever it fell out, and so the cock-crow was once led away by the night and not let loose at all; and yet it was always twilight before anyone spoke of the princess or the maid, or looked at the bird, and never once did anybody think of calling them back to their homes at all, as was the custom in Japan; and indeed when the princess or maid had been led away, none of the household would give her anything to eat or drink; so Kanga had to be continually reminded on every hand of what she had stolen or what had been promised, or thought she had stolen, by all means, to nobody: and at last when Kanga was forced to give up her pig for good, and could not bring herself to give up her tail for him, and had to be led away in front of everybody in the forest, and never once had anybody dared to call her back; and yet the old stories were all so silly and ridiculous that when Kanga went home the peasants said to one another, ‘The little old princess is going to live on till we get her back at last, or else the time when we are forced to keep watch over her won’t come round at all, and will ruin everything we have worked so hard to get,’--even though nobody knew what was going on or where the princess was; and there was nobody to go to seek her, and nobody would take her in; and at last one night when it was quite dark she fell asleep on the stairs and slept till it was twilight, and slept until it was daylight, and then nobody heard her crying; and there was nothing to do but go to the castle and ask for her: and nobody ever went there but a servant, or a valet or a valet in his place, for nobody would believe it possible for anybody to live so wretchedly there as he did; and it was strange how they kept trying to make up stories to keep Kanga alive, even though nobody ever said a word of what was going on, or how the princess could get the medicine so that she might get better clothes: and Kanga, however well she tried, could never get out of her bed, for she did not know what had become of the old stories, and they kept feeding her the same old stories in the same old order as she had always been fed: and at last one night it was as if some invisible spell was binding her, and it seemed to be holding her tight to all the kingdoms of the earth and bidding her never to open her mouth to speak, and yet no sound it was able to draw out came from beneath the spell, for every sound that came she was seized with an indescribable terror and could scarcely move about, and when Kanga cried out she could hardly stir or think how she should get off at all; and it was only at this last moment when one of the robbers would come forward and slap her across the face, and slap her till she screamed out again, until at last she was turned into stone and went down into the deepest pit without any way of escape and could neither call her mother to her help nor anybody to save her from the scoundrels.\n"]}]}]}
