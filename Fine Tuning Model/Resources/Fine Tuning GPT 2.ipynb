Indeed, the Nautilus hadn’t left the narrow, winding channel through which it had dived on the morning of July 2 while surveying its every move, an experience that they, and not the man, must have regretted at the time they were undertaking! And while these three gentlemen did indeed regret leaving their ocean companion stranded, it was undeniable that they wished no more than to resume their usual casual dialogue in their natural language! “You were right for this! I’ll return to the ship, it seems pointless spending time on the surface, and then, once we return, see where we stand on the food chain.” “Athos also,” Ned said serenely, returning to his former place on the seafloor where his Nautilus was silently hunting its prey, “will take our places, in case we’re interrupted by an obstacle or an unexpected frigate.” There followed intense silence throughout this lecture by the chief officer and one of his lieutenants, during which Ned took every opportunity to reassure their leader by expressing regret at what had happened during their stroll around the Nautilus’s interior! “Professor,” I said, “there exist only three men aboard this Nautilus—the captain, chief officer, and me.” “Then what are their names, sir?” “My companions,” the commander replied in a stifled voice, “are only a surname and an abbrancy! All three of them were aboard this ship during the time we’ve been floating in the open sea—without taking our eye off their comrades!
