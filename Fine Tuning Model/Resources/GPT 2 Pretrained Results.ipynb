But when she came, she found the world she was dreaming of was still in the past. The only person she knows in the past is she is from the past.\n","\n","She had to destroy her past life, learn how to live again. She had to become stronger to become a savior. She had to kill her own mother and take her place at his side.\n","\n","And so she did, killing her father who was now only a distant past memory. Then she ran away from home.\n","\n","It was only now, twenty five years had passed, that she finally realized just how bad this nightmare her past life had brought about and that she had gotten even more screwed up in her later years. She had always wanted to know what happened to the Earth before it was wiped out so that she can fix what happened to it to get back on track. At this point in the adventure, it had never even occurred to her why she should be so determined to fix all of the destruction she caused in her earlier life. That was until she realized the full scope of it all, but didn't care anymore, because he was her brother and she still loved him so much. She wasn't sure if she really loved him at that moment. But now he seemed to find her as a person. She wasn't sure if there would always be time to find out but maybe that would eventually happen when she realized the extent of what she was truly capable of. In any event, it didn't have to happen that way because she didn't care at all anymore, because even though she thought she loved him and she wanted to show him love again, she knew that it was only now because she realized the magnitude of the problem she had already created that she could actually make another attempt at fixing things, just with a different direction.\n","\n","So, she spent all of her savings to purchase a plane, with the understanding that at some point the world would be saved. After five years and six trips around the world, she eventually bought a real-life one and flew it to England to become a pilot, but it had already come to the point where it wouldn't fly at all anymore. There was a plane she wasn't happy about but she figured she would live with that for the future. Just as she was thinking about this when the helicopter finally arrived at the location they needed to fix the place, she felt something and she turned around to see the girl who'd made the trip to save it from the wrecking ball had appeared before her with her back to them.\n","\n","\"I know about you. I've heard a lot about you. This was your first adventure. I think I'm not from earth anymore. I think. You must be pretty surprised.\"\n","\n","\"Um...yes. I am. Sorry, I felt a bit bad.\"\n","\n","\"You didn't say you didn't care about us.\"\n","\n","The girl looked embarrassed. \"No...I do. I wanted to see you. I wanted to help you.\"\n","\n","\"It was a dream.\" And this time, she didn't apologize. She told it as it actually happened.\n","\n","The man looked embarrassed, his face turning red. \"I never had that dream. Just the one where you showed up in my life. It was for you. In my dreams. Just for you.\" The boy sighed. \"It was always for me. Before this, I just wanted to become something better. If I could change everything, I would have just done that and had a great life for you.\" The man sighed again.\n","\n","\"And I think the world would be different if you were alive,\" she said to him sadly. \"Why did you do such a awful thing?\"\n","\n","When the boy smiled, he seemed surprised and just sort of looked at her as if that were normal, and then he laughed. \"It was because you needed to. It was time for me to come back. I needed that help. To live for the first time as a normal person. And that is when things changed.\"\n","\n","It was the first smile on his face she'd seen since that dream, so she felt like she was seeing that again. It was a genuine, warm smile, not like it was faked. He didn't have to try too hard. He was willing to meet her in her dream-state. And she could tell that even though the dream was unreal, it still had meaning to him, despite the fact the dream wasn't true at that point.\n","\n","\"What is happening?\" she asked him, when she didn't have any more time to talk at all.\n","\n","\"Well, I'm coming with you now.

The mountain ridges surrounding them became a huge, deadly wall of lightning.\n","As for the remaining soldiers and soldiers who had escaped, they began to panic as they were hit by one after another blast of lightning before they lost consciousness from their agony.\n","As of the time the fire began to spread, around 150,000 people were already dead or wounded on the road, and it had only taken around 30 seconds for the entire scene to transform into a death-trap. It was obvious that after this gigantic explosion, the air had completely lost its resistance and had completely evaporated due to the sheer force of the thundering thunder.\n","\"Nyah…\"\n","All of the soldiers who were thrown into the air while flying from the front started to scream as their bodies began to go numb from the shockwaves. The most important point of all was…\n","\"Peng, peng, peng…\"\n","The ground immediately shook from their impact with it, causing everything on the surface of the mountain to shake. Even the rock underneath their feet started to split into numerous fragments, making them feel like they could fall off at any moment.\n","Even before the soldiers could get up from the mountain ridges that were now falling down, a huge amount of blood started to come out of the mountain, and were spilling out in front of the soldiers who were blown away by the thunder. As long as they stopped moving, they were doomed to die. The sky in the surrounding area was covered in the blood of the dead, and it wasn't long until the blood was falling to the ground in front of them.\n","They couldn't hear any sound coming from anything inside the cave, so the soldiers could only watch as the cave began to slowly collapse.\n","\"Nyah~….\"\n","The soldiers who were caught in that wall of lightning were thrown to the back by lightning during the thunderstorm. In spite of the pain they were experiencing, they were already too exhausted to fight back.\n","\"Wai, Wai~. What do I do!?\"\n","\"Just a little longer, we better hurry up and go.\"\n","The leader of the soldiers who were thrown by the lightning yelled out, as if it would be an easy task. The leader looked down at his wounded body, who still couldn't move. He could feel his entire body cracking under his hands and feet, which wasn't something anyone should experience before they die, but he took the decision not to think about it, and took a moment to reflect on his circumstances. However, for some reason, he thought that he should not hesitate to kill the rest of them, even after seeing through their pain. After all, they weren't any stronger than the first one. However, even that guy was a monster in his own opinion.\n","He just couldn't understand why he wanted to kill those other humans, for they were all his own little children, and couldn't just kill them like that.\n","He couldn't bear to tell the other soldiers about his secret. It would only make his killing spree even stronger. He could only hope he could have a few of them alive for an opportunity to kill.\n","But when they looked at him, it was like a scene from a nightmare. The leaders and soldiers who were sent flying by lightning looked at the soldiers on the ground, and then they started laughing.\n","After the scene they were seeing from afar, every single member of the team raised a hand to wave them away to the side, and then the leader shouted a few times. The soldiers then looked around in confusion. The leader then started to lead the group of soldiers forward. However, they looked at each other, and everyone knew that the leader of the party was dead as well.\n","Everyone then realized their mistake and tried to run to the back. They didn't even try to run to the top of the mountains\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Set the model to evaluate to run prompts on the model for generation\n","model.eval()\n","\n","prompt_text = \"He loved her so ardently\"\n","\n","#Convert the prompt text to tokens and add the attention mask\n","input_ids = tokenizer(prompt_text, return_tensors = \"pt\").input_ids\n","attention_mask = tokenizer(\n","    prompt_text, return_tensors=\"pt\"\n",").attention_mask\n","\n","#Send converted prompt and attention mask to GPU\n","input_ids = input_ids.to(device)\n","attention_mask = attention_mask.to(device)\n","\n","\n","#Generate the output from the model based on the parameter set here\n","output = model.generate(\n","    input_ids = input_ids,\n","    attention_mask = attention_mask,\n","    pad_token_id = tokenizer.pad_token_id,\n","    max_length = 1024,\n","    num_beams = 10,\n","    min_length = 1000,\n","    temperature = 3.5,\n","    top_k = 50,\n","    do_sample = True,\n",")\n","\n","\n","generated_text = tokenizer.decode(output[0],skip_special_tokens = True)\n","\n","print(generated_text)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"QlDLmZFWug1h","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1704278857339,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":45474,"user":{"displayName":"Mahamuge Dinendra Costa","userId":"17358276780992758429"}},"outputId":"460ba6f0-dd67-4e10-8e88-2031cc632fbf"},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["He loved her so ardently that his heart was bursting with fear, and he wished to die as soon as possible, fearing that her death would be like to himself.

When it was day they were sitting at table by candlelight, preparing for supper.\n","\n","When her husband returned, he embraced her and said that he wanted no more to have her, so much so that for some time he thought it would make him well.

He had just turned up from work when, at seven o'clock in the evening, she called on him, to give him a kiss and to come to her. He hesitated a moment, although he felt certain that if he did not tell her that she must be happy, he should be put out. He did not dare to tell her how much he enjoyed it, for he was afraid of being put out, and he had never thought that he would be put out; yet he could not help himself.

She knew that he would not have left her to go home alone.

But she knew it was not her fault that she had had no sleep, for in the middle of the night he entered and lay down down beside her. He kissed her hand and said that he would be there for her till he slept. The next morning he came and was very glad that he could see her, but if he was afraid that they would be put out of the house, he should not go into it. She began to tell him of herself; she told him everything that had happened to herself.

He was extremely grateful, and seemed to think that she had done everything for him and she was sorry for herself and for her husband; for he could never believe that the one who loved her the most could hate him the least, and that the one best suited to her was he. She said he was jealous that she had not given him anything more to do than she desired him.

Please lay me gently in the earth. I know you have no intention of touching me yet, but if I go down, I go up.\" (Ch. 2, Verse 24)\n","Posted by Dr. Kevin D. Johnson at 09:16 PM 1 comment: Tweet\n","The Gospel of John contains an incredible statement by Jesus Himself, in Luke 3:1-10:\n","\"And once more it came to pass. As they walked along it came to pass, as many as they passed by, said, Who are these who walk not after the tradition of Israel, that they have turned aside, and the traditions of their fathers?\" \"Who are these who believe not?\" \"If ye be indeed as I say, and believe not that I speak unto men of men, then are ye but sinners along with them: for ye believe not that I came from heaven, nor that I sent my Son, though I am sent after thine own eye.\" (Luke 3:9-10) We have had many interpretations of these two expressions, many of which fall short of what is implied by the rest of the verse. Regardless of what you decide to believe on the interpretation, this statement from John does speak a lot about Jesus:   \"And again he said unto the men, Take heed and remember to keep my commandments, even those which I have given you. Remember this, that when ye come into Judaea, it shall be a day of tribulation for the Jews: for they shall know that I came not to send Peace to the world through their brethren: but to destroy them that love me; and to give them their retribution.\" (Mark 12:37)\n","From this quote we know that according to Jesus' teachings, He did in fact come as a representative of God's law, and not to \"settle for Himself the sons of perdition through the Law,\" (Matthew 12:41) which is what many modern day Christians would say (and others who don't). Furthermore, the implication of the quote seems to indicate to many that since Jesus is an incarnation of God, we too should not be bound by the sins of the past, which is incorrect. Here is another passage that gives us a glimpse into the inner essence of this statement: \"And when he was taken up from thence, both Peter and John came and saw him, and they said to him, Master, how was it that thou didst go up again to Galilee, even to bear our sins, to go down to Jerusalem, even to go down into the regions of this world? And he said unto them, You know not, Simon, whether I am come into the world to do whatsoever pleases the flesh; or whether I was ashamed of my body, and have come into it willingly. For behold, there is power in Christ, even as in the power of God. But because ye know not, John, that I came not to bear thine uncleanness: but that I came to do a good work; whether it be that I were dead in my trespasses, or that I had fallen asleep in my sins, in which I now am dead, yet I come to bear your iniquities. I am even as the Father in my sins: behold, I do not lie, but he that heareth me shall live.\" (Matthew 28:28-31)\n","From our perspective, it seems abundantly clear that these are statements directly related to the suffering of Jesus and His ministry. It also seems abundantly clear that Jesus made it clear that the sins of Israel are not his to touch, and that if He does go to the cross that we are on the wrong path. The fact that the phrase \"that I came to bear your insitutions\" implies that the sins of Israel are only for the good works of the kingdom of heaven, seems to conflict with Jesus' statement, that in He is \"not at the end, but beginning.\" In other words, He will be a Savior for all time, and he will be the one who makes peace between them. In other words, Jesus is not the end, but beginning of the kingdom. He is the first to come to restore His kingdom.\n","Is Jesus the Messiah we have been seeking for all of our faith? What does this mean?\n","As you can clearly see, the message here is that we aren't. \n","It says we aren't Jesus Christ. We didn't begin to be a Christ. We are not the Christ we seek, but we do know Jesus and that He loves us. The message here is that you don't start out with faith, but that as Jesus has done, He has revealed Himself to save us by the blood of the Christ. \n","The same message holds true for our salvation in the Kingdom. Jesus Christ will come with a change in our hearts to guide us. He will give us the answer we need when we ask for the truth of what we are\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Set the model to evaluate to run prompts on the model for generation\n","model.eval()\n","\n","prompt_text = \"No grave can hold my body down\"\n","\n","#Convert the prompt text to tokens and add the attention mask\n","input_ids = tokenizer(prompt_text, return_tensors = \"pt\").input_ids\n","attention_mask = tokenizer(\n","    prompt_text, return_tensors=\"pt\"\n",").attention_mask\n","\n","#Send converted prompt and attention mask to GPU\n","input_ids = input_ids.to(device)\n","attention_mask = attention_mask.to(device)\n","\n","\n","#Generate the output from the model based on the parameter set here\n","output = model.generate(\n","    input_ids = input_ids,\n","    attention_mask = attention_mask,\n","    pad_token_id = tokenizer.pad_token_id,\n","    max_length = 1024,\n","    num_beams = 10,\n","    min_length = 1000,\n","    temperature = 3.5,\n","    top_k = 50,\n","    do_sample = True,\n",")\n","\n","\n","generated_text = tokenizer.decode(output[0],skip_special_tokens = True)\n","\n","print(generated_text)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"vaOosc_WugZP","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1704278947863,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":45170,"user":{"displayName":"Mahamuge Dinendra Costa","userId":"17358276780992758429"}},"outputId":"0196a165-5204-46de-c155-8c0d83d52e0e"},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["No grave can hold my body down to the ground, I must be crushed to pieces in front of your eyes; I must die on your watch.\"\n","On the other hand it could make sense to not be angry with them.\n","\"What a pity there is no one to punish you, my little sister.

He had no idea how he was supposed to stop them. If he could not, then what was he supposed to fight against the other demon that was waiting for him here? He could never see how he should defeat this demon in order to destroy it, but the fact of the matter now was, in his current state of mind, all he was doing was waiting for the time when the witch had to leave and when he could finally kill the demon that was draining his strength and killing him.

The demon was looking at him; it was an enemy that had been preparing for him all along. If he gave it enough time, it would end its life and his own as a result of killing the demon that was killing him. So what were they fighting for? Should he kill them now, and then give it a chance, or should he try to let them live?

The head of a black-haired person came into his vision with a small, round smile as it spoke, \"You have to believe in me. I won't die and that is because of you.\" The arms of the other demon dropped him as he fell and he saw a woman standing in a circle in his vision. He felt another arm and looked at the hands grabbing his head when the hand came up again.\n","\n","\"We are not the only ones who believe in me. All of them want to save their world.\" the woman said, and her face said it all. She waved her hand at him and then her voice came through in his vision. \"You must do this.

We don't know if it's safe from the elements. You've seen what it can do for us before.\" The bear smiled widely. \"In my day I used to come here at night sometimes. We had a good time, they were fun times. I'm sure we were all together sometimes. Now that you've met me, I think that we're all a bunch of broken up old men. As long as we're doing what we have to.\"\n","\n","His bear companion then began to climb down the ladder, \"We have to take everything with us. If this is the only thing we can take…we're already here, we're still going to die tomorrow, tomorrow we will. If you can't do it, I promise you that we can.\"\n","\n","His bear companion paused, unsure of what to do, before he gave a deep sigh and turned his head away, \"No…I cannot…I cannot do this. No one who I know can fight this. Not them, or you. Not you. For me it's the same as it is for the bear, no matter what the situation is. I will follow you no matter where you go, in the end you will find happiness.\"\n","\n","With that his bear companion gave a quick nod in agreement, then began to walk back to his cave. The soldiers were still crying and screaming, but they were still alive. As they lay there, one of them finally spoke aloud. There were no words, they could only think, they had never known anything but death and pain. He reached for his rifle and fired the last round, causing a small explosion, and then turned to the other soldiers standing in the direction of the cave and asked, \"Are you ready? Are you going to take your chances and give up on them? Then you will be left here to rot in misery. If you stay here and give them the option of leaving and coming back again, are you truly prepared for that?\"\n","\n","His soldier companion hesitated for a moment, \"No…no…I cannot leave them here because I refuse to face them,\" he said carefully. \"They are my enemies. I hate them for their hatred, but in my heart I'm willing to fight them for the simple reason that I have to.\"\n","\n","The soldier next to him then hesitated a second before he spoke again, \"My friend, you are not alone here. I hope you will do what you have to do to the soldiers here. I don't expect you'll die, I just hope to save a few people from getting killed, but even more than that I pray that you will not suffer. I pray that you don't die. And I pray that in the future you will be with the bear. You see, I understand that you're not here to play with me anymore. You were only doing what I asked you to. However, I want you to know I see you as someone important to me. So if you don't show any mercy I'm willing to throw you out. So please don't just stand there like a statue, begging for mercy and then let the bear win.\" Then he turned back to the other soldiers and stood to leave. However, one of their soldiers had a look across the room at his wounded friend, then at him again. The boy looked back as though to say something. The boy then nodded, and turned to them as well. \"Do you understand me, friend?\"\n","\n","The soldier spoke again, \"You want to see the bear with the injured soldier?\"\n","\n","The bear looked over at the two soldiers, \"If you're not afraid, why the hell are you asking me questions?\" With that, it raised the ears back up to ears level again, \"Now, what do you want. Do you want me to take you with me or should I let you walk on your own just like we did to the other soldiers? If you insist on following me, I'm happy to walk with you. But you are the same as we have all been from the start, so keep your distance.\" It lowered its eyes slightly at the question.\n","\n","\"All right,\" the boy hesitated.

As the earthshaker's blade plunged into his flesh, his eyes sparkled.\n","\n","The world shuddered, but he didn't get angry. The death was too merciful.\n","\n","Then he saw the earth shaking, as if some unseen force were trying to shake apart all life on earth. \"You're an animal. You have no feelings. You don't even have a soul to give meaning to what you are now. Let me save you.\"\n","\n","At that, the earthshaker's eyes flashed black, and he fell silent, stunned by the vision. \"I...I can't go with you.\"\n","\n","The earthshaker knew that he couldn't. \"I will kill you. The earth will destroy me. You'll live on as nothing. I'll be gone and forgotten.\"\n","\n","And the earth's earth was about to destroy him, the earth's earth. But the earth was alive. It wasn't a dream, this world was alive to him, and he didn't think about anything else. It would be impossible to kill this world. It would burn the earth to ash, and the earth would bury him. He couldn't live forever with it. If it happened, it was a terrible fate indeed. The earth would tear him to pieces too, and he knew he couldn't help it. Or if he was to die on the dragon's back, the earth would bury him too.\n","\n","He was tired. He could barely move. And his eyes were red.\n","\n","\"This is the only chance. I will not give you away. You are not a coward, you are not a weakling, a weakling won't surrender. This world would not be my home, and it's not mine, and I...I don't have to die.\"\n","\n","His body was shaking as if it were on a rampage. It had been an hour since he'd last fed it. How could he resist the dragon? It was more likely the dragon would kill him when he was tired anyway. There was just no chance in hell that this world could stay alive for much longer if the earth's earth did. He wouldn't listen to any of the ponies in danger, and neither would the dragons. He could not keep this world from falling. The earth had to die. \"No!\" he said fiercely. \"I...I can't. How am I going to save you?! I've given up everything I've ever known! I'll die here without a purpose! Even if it means my entire life is wasted, then that is the only way to save the world! All...all I ask is...I want to live!

The next day she was brought here along with three others, and was sentenced to life imprisonment in the dungeon. After being imprisoned for almost one full day, they were finally released in the evening. A new prisoner came along and this one was even crazier. He was even bigger, longer, and taller than Nihara. He was also the only prisoner in his world who did not appear from his own world.\n","\n","Nihara was sent back to earth.\n","\n","\"I didn't even have any words. How could I think I deserved to go to such a wretched place? What kind of idiot did Nihara serve? I wonder if they would have let her go back if I didn't have any hatred in me.\" Shizuka told the people in her room when she returned.\n","\n","\"Are you still alive? Do you remember when I brought you back?\" Taka-kun asked.\n","\n","\"They let her go because she was a dangerous criminal with no regard for mankind. It was only a matter of time before they finally decided that she couldn't be trusted to run a shop.\"\n","\n","\"So she was brought back like this to serve the Demon God Nihara Nihara. Is there any way to free her from life imprisonment for the next few years?\" Nita asked.\n","\n","\"I'm not aware of how long they'll take to get her out.\" Sōma agreed.\n","\n","\"Do you care? She was my only one. Do you believe she would have a chance to escape if she died? I don't want the Demon God Nihara Nihara back in any shape, size, color or shape you wish it to be.\" Yui-chan asked.\n","\n","\"Why would we allow her back to our world?\" Nitta demanded. \"Do you not know that we are humans and can't be spared by people like her? Even worse, why would you think she deserves to serve the Demon God even more? It really is horrible!\"\n","\n","Tsukishima decided to let her out. She was allowed to move freely inside the dungeon to do her work while being allowed to go outside to kill any Demons that appeared. She even managed to escape in time. However she didn't tell anyone the truth about what happened outside the dungeon. The guards tried to attack her every time they came to check on her. One of them was injured and tried to leave the city. However she continued working despite that. Eventually, all the guards were so scared that they just stopped attacking and just stood their ground until she escaped.\n","\n","\"Tsukishima, you had no idea what you'd been playing with!\" Shizuka yelled out, \"You let her die like this, and she should have just been killed in front of us. We are the one who must pay for this. You have to promise not to kill the ones who killed her for nothing. Now that we have the Demon Gods out, it would be great to not only kill them, but the people who are in the same room with them to kill the other ones too. You must protect those who are suffering, no matter what!\"\n","\n","After that, Tsuishima ended the trial for everyone and sent Yui-chan off to her world again. She wasn't quite able to save Nihara from getting killed by Yuki, but in the end Yuki managed to save her life. Not long after she returned, they arrived at the Great Temple to start their new lives.\n","\n","\"The first thing I wish to do is to teach the Demon God to forgive us humans by making him see that we, the humans, can become gods.\" Yuki promised. \"One day, if you do this you too would become the god, and I believe in this, that's why I don't think you would ever harm us humans again. I promise to stop doing that. It would be really hard for you if I don't.\"\n","\n","\"Don't forget your dreams. I won't try and kill you again soon, but that doesn't mean you won't try again. I promise to keep that promise.\" She said.\n","\n","As a way to honor Niki, Tsuishima made sure that there were a lot of toys in her household. A lot of Niki's favorite things were always around her house to be enjoyed by everyone. The ones that would become her greatest heroes.\n","\n","Yui-chan got her own house to enjoy. She even started building up her own castle inside her own home and started serving her own demons as her knights and guards. Yui-chan made sure everyone's house was very clean, even when it wasn't her house it would always be cleaned\n"]}]}]}
